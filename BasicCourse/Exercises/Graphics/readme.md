## A macro to build a graph
Create a macro which builds a graph with the following features:
- The title of the plot is *My graph*
- The x and y axis have labels *my_{X}* and *myY* respectively
- The points are three and with these coordinates (1,0), (2,3), (3,4)
- The marker is a full square. Its coulour is red.
- A line joins the points and is orange

One of the possible solutions (this is software, there are many solutions!) is the macro [SimpleGraph.C](SimpleGraph.C).
