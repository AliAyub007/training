# Fitting and parameter estimation
Welcome to the exercises of the "Fitting and parameter estimation" learning module!

## Your First fit with ROOT
The macro **firstFit.C** is only half-way complete. In the code a fit of a histogram is performed
and the parameters of the fitted model are inspected.
Try to complete the code putting to a good use what you learned during the lectures.
The solution is available in the **firstFit_Solution.C** macro.

## Correlation of Parameters
The **correlatedParameters.py** contains a simple program which fits an exponential to a histogram. It seems that there is a problem. While the fit parameters look ok, the correlation matrix shows something fishy. Can you say what is going wrong and why?
